# automatic-attendance
Automatic Attendance using Face Recognition website written in TS - making use of the MERN Stack and face-api.js library.

This project was taken over from a college senior. With most of the codes having been reworked along with ___major___ bug fixes, new features as well as overall improvements on user experiences.

`(Note: This is also my first time working with everything listed above, as well as my first time working with a fullstack web application so some parts of the codes are not very optimized/clean)`

### New Features
- (will be updated soon)

### Other Changes
- (will be updated soon)

### Current Known Bugs / Known Issues:
- Courses searching states are still kept when user navigate to another component (they can only be reset after a re-render).
- Automatic attendance checkmarks are not displayed correctly / Student attendance count not displaying correctly due to the PUT and GET APIs running seperately(?). This would end up making the dispatch not working as intended - a simple page refresh would fix most of it (this is only a temporary solution for now).
- Deployment is currently not possible since this is purely a development build. Its only purpose is for experimenting. 

<b>(Deployment builds are in seperate repositories. You can check them out here:
