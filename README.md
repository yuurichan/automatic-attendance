# automatic-attendance
Automatic Attendance using Face Recognition website written in TS - making use of the MERN Stack and face-api.js library.

This project was taken over from a college senior. With most of the codes having been reworked along with ___major___ bug fixes, new features as well as overall improvements on user experiences.

### New Features
- (will be updated soon)

### Other Changes
- (will be updated soon)

### Current Known Bugs / Known Issues:
- Courses searching states are still kept when user navigate to another component (they can be only reset after a re-render).
- Automatic attendance checkmarks are not displayed correctly / Student attendance count not displaying correctly due to the PUT and GET APIs running seperately(?). This would end up making the dispatch not working as intended - a simple page refresh would fix most of it (this is only a temporary solution for now).

### Installation:
#### will be updated soon
